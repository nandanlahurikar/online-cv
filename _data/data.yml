      details: |
        Built linear regression model on the scores 20K students and predicted 75% improvement in students’ progress.
        Advised client to improve the program by fostering reading in the specific community within the state.
        Developed data visualization models and tableau dashboards to present the client with business insights.
        Used pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn in python for developing various machine learning models and utilized algorithms such as linear regression, xgboost, logistic regression, decision tree and SVM.
        Remove outliers in the data using standard deviation.
        Used cross-validation to test the models with different batches of data to optimize the models and prevent overfitting.
        Developed end to end image classification pipeline to categorize connector’s position in to 3 classes.
        Designed deep neural network from scratch using convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout, filters and fully connected layers. Improved model accuracy by 20 % using data augmentation.
        Helped client to achieve better output with 95% accuracy.

    assignments:
      - title: Vehicle Detection and Tracking
        link: "https://github.com/nandanlahurikar/Vehicle-Detection-and-Tracking/blob/master/CarND-Vehicle-Detection%20Soln.ipynb"
        tagline: "Applied different feature extraction technique such as HOG and color spaces to identify car in an image.
                  Designed Classifier that distinguish  from car images from no car images. (Images-feature extractor-algorithm).
                  Used sliding window technique to detect car in an image, Applied bounding boxes that will detect car while coming ongoing.
                  Used heat map to detect the false positive, heat map assign 1 each time it detects a car, averaging this detection over certain mapping make it either hot or cool.
"

      - title: Advance Lane Detection
        link: "https://github.com/nandanlahurikar/Advance-Lane-Finding"
        tagline: "Built an algorithm that detects lanes of road. Used camera calibration, color thresholding, and a perspective transform technique to detect road lanes.
                  Improved further lane detection by implementing curve fitting and sliding window.
                  Identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement. Overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes.
"

      - title: Traffic Sign Classification
        link: "https://github.com/nandanlahurikar/Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb"
        tagline: "Built and trained a CNN to classify traffic signs and  optimized network using top 5 predictions.
                  Successfully tested images around 93% validation accuracy by overcoming data and over fitting challenges."

      - title: Deep Learning to Clone Driving Behavior
        link: "https://github.com/nandanlahurikar/Behavioral-Cloning"
        tagline: "Controlled steering angle for end-to-end driving using CNN, optimized network by regularization and dropout.
                  Overcame control challenges by pre-processing images, generalized the network for driving on multiple tracks."
